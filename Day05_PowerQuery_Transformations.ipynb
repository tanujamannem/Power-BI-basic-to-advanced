        "\n",
        "# ⭐ 1. Overview of Transformations\n",
        "\n",
        "Transformations in Power Query allow you to **reshape, clean, and prepare data** for analysis.  \n",
        "Common transformations include **splitting, merging, appending tables, and creating conditional columns**.\n",

        "# ⭐ 2. Split Columns\n",
        "\n",
        "- Split columns by delimiter (comma, space, hyphen)  \n",
        "- Split columns by number of characters  \n",
        "- Useful for extracting meaningful information from combined fields (e.g., \"City, State\")  \n",

        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "# ⭐ 3. Merge Tables\n",
        "\n",
        "- Combine two tables **horizontally** based on a common column  \n",
        "- Similar to SQL JOIN operations  \n",
        "- Types of joins: Inner, Left Outer, Right Outer, Full Outer, Anti, etc.  \n",
        "- Example: Merge Sales table with Product table to add product details  \n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "# ⭐ 4. Append Tables\n",
        "\n",
        "- Combine two or more tables **vertically** (stack rows)  \n",
        "- Column names and data types should match  \n",
        "- Useful for combining monthly or yearly data into a single table  \n",

        "\n",
        "# ⭐ 5. Conditional Columns\n",
        "\n",
        "- Create new columns based on conditions (if/then logic)  \n",
        "- Example: Create a \"Sales Category\" column:\n",
        "  - If Sales > 1000 → \"High\"  \n",
        "  - Else → \"Low\"  \n",
        "- Found under **Add Column → Conditional Column**\n",

        "\n",
        "- Extract parts: Year, Month, Day, Quarter, Weekday  \n",
        "- Add or subtract days, months, or years  \n",

        "1. Split **Customer Name** into First and Last Name  \n",
        "2. Merge Sales table with Product table to get category details  \n",
        "3. Append data from January and February into one table  \n",
        "4. Create a **Sales Category** column based on Sales Amount  \n",

        "\n",
        "- Transformations help **clean, reshape, and enrich data**  \n",
        "- Splitting, merging, and appending tables are essential for combining datasets  \n",
        "- Conditional columns allow **dynamic categorization**  \n",
        "- Text and date transformations improve **reporting and analysis accuracy**\n",
