        "1. **One-to-Many (1:*):**  \n",
        "   - A single row in one table matches multiple rows in another.  \n",
        "   - Example: Product table → Sales table.\n",

        "2. **Many-to-One (*:1):**  \n",
        "   - Reverse of One-to-Many.  \n",
        "   - Example: Sales table → Product table (same as above, depending on direction).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Many-to-Many (*:*):**  \n",
        "   - Multiple rows in both tables match each other.  \n",
        "   - Less common; use with caution.  \n",

        "- **Inactive Relationship:** Exists but not used unless explicitly activated using DAX (`USERELATIONSHIP`).  \n",
        "- **Example:** If a Sales table has multiple date columns (OrderDate, DeliveryDate), only one can be active at a time.\n",

        "- Example: Date table for Order Date and Delivery Date in Sales table.  \n",

        "4. Drag **Date** from Date table → Sales table OrderDate  \n",

        "\n",
        "- Prefer **One-to-Many relationships** wherever possible.  \n",
        "- Use **active relationships** for default calculations.  \n",
        "- Inactive relationships can be activated via **DAX USERELATIONSHIP**.  \n",
        "- Avoid unnecessary many-to-many relationships unless required.  \n",
        "- Maintain clear **primary and foreign keys** for each table.\n",

        "- Relationships enable **filtering, aggregation, and correct calculations**.  \n",
        "- Correct cardinality and cross-filter direction are crucial.  \n",
        "- Role-playing dimensions allow **flexible use of tables** without creating duplicates.  \n",
